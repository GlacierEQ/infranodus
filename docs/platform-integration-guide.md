3. **Export to MyMap.ai**: Send the graph to MyMap.ai
4. **Visual Refinement**: Arrange and enhance the map visually
5. **Further Analysis**: Apply MyMap.ai's analytical features

### Visual Creation to Network Analysis

1. **Start with Visuals**: Create a knowledge map in MyMap.ai
2. **Export to InfraNodus**: Send the graph to InfraNodus
3. **Text Enhancement**: Add textual content and context
4. **Network Analysis**: Apply InfraNodus's text network algorithms
5. **Iterate**: Continue refining between platforms

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the integration include:

- **Real-time Synchronization**: Keep graphs updated across platforms automatically
- **Collaborative Features**: Enable multi-user collaboration across platforms
- **Enhanced Attribute Mapping**: Support for more complex node/edge attributes
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-configured workflows for common use cases
- **API Expansion**: More comprehensive API coverage for advanced integration scenarios

## Getting Started

To use the integration features:

1. Navigate to "Integrations" in your InfraNodus settings
2. Connect your MyMap.ai account by entering your API key
3. Use the export/import tools to transfer graphs between platforms
4. Experiment with different workflows to find what works best for your needs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **API Connection Errors**: Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- **Missing Nodes/Edges**: Check that your graph complies with both platforms' data models
- **Performance Issues**: Large graphs may require optimization before transfer
- **Format Compatibility**: Ensure any custom attributes have appropriate mappings
