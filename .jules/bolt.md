## 2025-05-15 - [O(N^2) to O(N) Optimization in Entry.getNodes]
**Learning:** Significant performance bottleneck in graph data processing was caused by nested loops (O(N*M)) used for node weighting and linear searches (`Instruments.findInArray`) for context mapping. Replacing these with `Map` and `Set` lookups improved performance by ~97%.
**Action:** Prioritize `Map` and `Set` for data-heavy paths involving lookups or weight aggregation in this codebase.

## 2025-05-20 - [Optimized uniqualizeArray with Set]
**Learning:** Replaced object-based deduplication with `Set` in `Instruments.uniqualizeArray`. Using a `Set` provides O(1) average lookup and avoids issues with `Object.prototype` key collisions. Benchmark showed a 50-80% performance improvement for large arrays depending on the key function overhead.
**Action:** Always prefer `Set` over objects for tracking unique items to ensure both performance and safety against prototype-inherited keys.
